# Exercism

This is a repository of the Exercism problems that I've completed to date. I highly recommend [Exercism](http://exercism.io/) for programming language practice or for diving in to a new language, I'm having a lot of fun with the problems so far. Community feedback is always a welcome thing to have, and the testing frameworks are providing valuable instruction on unit testing, which is something that I have very little experience with.

## Languages Currently Included

- __Python__: I have some experience with Python already, from a scientific computing and numerical modeling perspective. I find it to be a very simple and elegant language. I try to avoid using Python 2.7 as much as I can in the professional world, because I don't believe in living in the past, but sometimes that's all that's installed on a computational cluster somewhere.

- __Perl 5__: Perl 5 I also have some experience in. Every time I write a short little project in Perl, it's a very rewarding experience. I seriously enjoy writing this language, I don't know why. I think because it provides the illusion of low-level control while still being a super high-level language like Python is. I have used Perl as a fully-featured design language with [PDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl_Data_Language) for scientific and mathematical purposes, but admittedly not often. In handling input files for neutronics (MCNP or SERPENT), reactor physics (SCALE or PARTISN), or computational fluid dynamics codes (STAR-CCM+ or OpenFOAM), Perl's prowess and ease is second to none, and is usually my go-to input/output parser for those projects.
