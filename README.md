# Exercism

This is a repository of the Exercism problems that I've completed to date. I highly recommend [Exercism](http://exercism.io/) for programming language practice or for diving in to a new language, I'm having a lot of fun with the problems so far. Community feedback is always a welcome thing to have, and the testing frameworks are providing valuable instruction on unit testing, which is something that I have very little experience with.

## Languages Currently Included

- Python: I have some experience with Python already, from a scientific computing and numerical modeling perspective. I find it to be a very simple and elegant language. I try to avoid using Python 2.7 as much as I can in the professional world, because I don't believe in living in the past, but sometimes that's all that's installed on a computational cluster somewhere.
